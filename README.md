# gtk-vpn-indicator
An applet to check the number of VPN interfaces. I was developed using GTK and for Ubuntu 18.04 (AppIndicator lib).

It's very simple:

just execute:
```
python3 vpn-indicator.py
```
The indicator will appear on top right of your Desktop Environment (I have used default ubuntu desktop environment.)
